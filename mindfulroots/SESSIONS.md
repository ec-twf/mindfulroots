## Opening message template

```
MindfulRoots project — session N

Repo: https://github.com/ec-twf/mindfulroots (public)
Working branch: feat/gap-integration-omega3-preview
Stack: Astro 5 + Tailwind v4, Netlify deploy (single build at end — no PR previews to save credits)

SESSION GOAL: [one sentence]

SCHEMA FIELDS ADDED (all in src/content.config.ts):
- Products: seoTitle, metaDescription, qualityCriterion, criterionRationale,
  criterionSourceUrl, recommendedProduct, comparison{}
- comparison fields: criterion, verdict, columns, rows[]
- rows fields: brand, productName, iherbKeyword, cells[], pass, pick, verifiedDate
- Blog: postType (pillar | buying-guide | comparison | explainer)

COMPONENT: src/components/ComparisonTable.astro
- Reusable across product hubs and future comparison blog posts
- verdict paragraph renders ABOVE the table on the product page
- Comparison block placed HIGH on product page (before article body, after shortDescription)

EVIDENCE WORKFLOW (per product):
1. Read pillar blog post + product .md to align with existing claims
2. Research trial literature to derive the criterion (what actually worked in studies)
3. Identify 3 brand candidates likely to meet/fail it (for instructive contrast)
4. User pastes real nutrition panel labels
5. Compute specs, verify pass/fail honestly, write verdict paragraph
6. Write YAML block into product .md, local npm run build to verify

COMPLETED PRODUCTS:
- omega-3-fish-oil   criterion: EPA ≥60% EPA+DHA, high concentration, IFOS purity  ✅ verified
- ashwagandha        criterion: named trialed extract (KSM-66/Sensoril/Shoden) + withanolides stated  ✅ verified

SEO: all 10 products have seoTitle + metaDescription
VOICE: all 10 products have botanical shortDescription

TODO THIS SESSION:
- [ ] [product name] — [criterion type from checklist]
- [ ] [product name] — [criterion type from checklist]

NETLIFY: conserve credits — local npm run build only, no merges to main until final deploy
SESSION ENDS WITH: git push to feat/gap-integration-omega3-preview (free, no Netlify build)
```
